# Solar Power dataset
Working with the [Solar Power Generation Data](https://www.kaggle.com/anikannal/solar-power-generation-data)

This project is in its early stages. See the [jupyter notebook](Solar_Power_Generation_Data/solar_power_data_exp_and_model_training.ipynb) for implementation details.

> This data has been gathered at two solar power plants in India over a 34 day period. It has two pairs of files - each pair has one power generation dataset and one sensor readings dataset. The power generation datasets are gathered at the inverter level - each inverter has multiple lines of solar panels attached to it. The sensor data is gathered at a plant level - single array of sensors optimally placed at the plant.
> 
> There are a few areas of concern at the solar power plant -
> 
> 1. Can we predict the power generation for next couple of days? - this allows for better grid management
> 2. Can we identify the need for panel cleaning/maintenance?
> 3. Can we identify faulty or suboptimally performing equipment?
